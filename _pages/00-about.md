__DeepCell__ is a program for segmenting individual cells in microscopy images using deep learning. Image segmentation is frequently the analysis bottleneck in single-cell live-cell imaging experiments. This program describes our efforts to approach this problem using deep learning.

Details about __DeepCell__ can be found in our manuscript:

To use __DeepCell__ [download the software](/DeepCell/download/) and visit the [getting started](/DeepCell/starting/) page for a quick tutorial.
